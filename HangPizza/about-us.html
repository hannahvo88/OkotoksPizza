                        When we‚Äôre not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we‚Äôre crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. 
                        From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.<br>

                    
                        After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. 
                        Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today‚Äôs family on the go.</p><br>

                    <p>Okotoks Pizza is one of our go to places for pizza. 
                        They have great variety, gluten sensitive options, and their food is delivered hot and fresh.
                        I've ordered lots from this location and that majority of the time there are no issues.
                        The odd time that something gets forgotten or mixed up they correct right away and often throw something in an extra for the trouble.

                <p>The crust actually had flavour.
                    It wasn't just flour water and baking powder.
                    The toppings were exactly as advertised, fresh, crisp and plentiful.
                    There was exactly enough cheese, so it wasn't greasy.
                    This is my new favorite pizza joint.
                    I never eat leftover pizza and I did with this one.
                    It truly was the best I've found here in Okotoks.
                    We will be back!

                <p>My first time ordering, and for pickup.  
                    It was  hot and ready to take home.  
                    I ordered their classic large pepperoni and mushroom with extra toppings.  
                    I mentioned it was my first time ordering from their shop, and the person on the phone said it would be no extra charge for double the toppings.  
                    Wow!!!  The pizza is delicious when I brought it home, their not kidding, nor the other Google reviewers.  
                    It's now my go to place for local amazing pizza!  I have their menu saved!  Thanks Okotoks Pizza! üëç</p><br>
